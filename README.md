# Description
A simple server-side configurable economy system with mob rewarding, trading and bounty components for those running public/private Forge servers without plugin capability. This project was made for that reason, a lack of standalone quality economy mods for forge MC 1.20.1, where components aren't present.

# Commands

## Trade component:
A secondary component of the mod, allowing a player to initialise a trade with another player from an item held in their hand, accepting, denying and cancelling trades is handle in-chat so player's don't have to type out a small command just to cancel a trade.
